# Reykjanesskagi
3D view of seismic data of the Reykjanesskagi peninsula, on 2024-01-14

I created a javascript program to convert seismic data to an STL file. This file can be viewed with 3D design software and possibly all 3D printer software. 
I was curious if I could see the shape of the magma channels under the village of Grindavik. In the period of jan 14 11:00 and jan 15 17:00, there were a large number of small quakes in the area of the eruption close to the village. The center of the file, stl-coordinate 0,0 is positioned on the middle of the roundabout south of the house on Efrahop that was first destroyed, latitude:63.84770 longitude:-22.42216

I wrote this program in a single afternoon and it might be full of bugs :-)  
I cannot tell whether the 3D picture shows the expected magma concentration. I am not an expert in the subject and the data that I could get my hands on is from a very short period. If somebody can supply the seismic data from a longer period, for instance retrieved in the period covering both eruptions, I would really like to give it another try.

I cannot supply the data that I used to create this STL file, I used a file from a website without asking for permission ;-)
